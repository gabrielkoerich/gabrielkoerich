## Want to take profits and at the same time gradually taking profits?
Provide liquidity on Orca's Whirlpools!
Doesn't know how it works?  🧵👇

Let’s say I had 1 $SOL, and wanted to “DCA out” into $USDC… 

First, I’ll find an $SOL-$USDC LP with high liquidity utilization (volume/fees⬆️)

As you can see below, this 0.3%, yet this is a fkng hight yield:  🧵👇

Yeah, this pool has more than you need, and may retire your family in one year as return NOW.   

Is this faire tale? No. This is concentrated liquidity.

Solana guys are just not used to it. But how tf it works?.

Ok, now I got my attention. but what the f* is concentrated liquidity?  
-------

(With UniV2 calculations, 22.08k*365=8.059m/11.95m->67.44% APR)
However, with UniV3, there’s no effective method to calculate potential APRs due to liquidity concentration, JIT bots (Just in time LPers, aka MEV for LPing), etc
----
Now, let’s say I wanted to gradually sell (LP) my 10 $ETH between 1.7k and 2k $
This would be single-sided LPing, as price of $ETH (at the time of writing) is 1.63k (out of range, wouldn’t earn LP fees)

As the price of $ETH climbs above 1.7k, making it’s way through my provided $ETH liquidity (in range), my balance of $ETH will start to decrease+balance of $USDC will start to increase, earning LP trading fees while doing so!
(As my provided liquidity is utilized for swaps)
---
Ultimately, when $ETH climbs to 2k+, my LP position will once again be out of range, leaving me with single-sided $USDC liquidity + trading fees from my liquidity when it was in-range.
(Which is exactly what I wanted!)
----
Since my 10 ETH in single sided liquidity started being utilized at 1.7k/ETH (17k$), I would be left with 18.5k $USDC+LP fees at 2k/$ETH, leaving me with 7.5% IL if I would’ve simply held the ETH (18.5k/20k)
(IL is amplified based on LP position concentration)

In other words, I earned those juicy LP fees WHILST DCAing out of my $ETH position — which I already planned on doing!
The longer my LP position stays within the 1.7-2k range->the more trading fees earned 👀
