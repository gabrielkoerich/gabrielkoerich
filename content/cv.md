## Summary

A technical, productivity-focused software engineer and entrepreneur with over 15 years of professional experience building scalable systems (2008–Present). I started programming at age 13 out of pure curiosity about how things work—an early passion that evolved into a career building everything from marketing automation platforms to DeFi protocols. I combine deep expertise in both traditional backend development and blockchain engineering (Rust/Solana or EVM/Solidity) to create secure, high-performance applications.

As founder of Bulldesk (acquired 2021), I developed strong product intuition and business skills that complements my technical skills. My background in Business Administration/Finance (BBA) gives me unique insight when building fintech and DeFi solutions.

Currently focused on smart contract development and DeFi protocol architecture, with experience building systems that have scaled to +$100M TVL. Passionate about clean code, rigorous testing, and solving real-world problems.
