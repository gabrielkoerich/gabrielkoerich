### Hi there 👋

I'm a technical, productivity focused entrepreneur & software engineer.

With over 17 years of experience in software development, I love to be challenged and solve real world problems, especially when related to finance.

Since 2021 I've been using Rust as main language and digging deeper on the Solana ecosystem.

I started coding at 13 out of curiosity. 17+ years later, I'm building DeFi protocols and scalable systems.

Currently architecting Solana smart contracts at <a href="https://lulo.fi" target="_blank">Lulo</a> (+$100M TVL).

Previously founded Bulldesk (marketing automation SaaS, acquired 2021).
