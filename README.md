### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical, productivity focused entrepreneur. Graduated in Business Administration and self-taught in software development. 

Love to solve problems developing ideas and transforming them in reality, especially if related to marketing or finance. 

Over 12 years of experience in web development (full-stack).

Main focus is backend, my passion is to understand the problem and come up with a beautiful software architecture to solve it.

In this last year I've been focusing on smart contract development with Rust.

I also love to work with data analysis, building usefull dashboards for businesses decisions.
